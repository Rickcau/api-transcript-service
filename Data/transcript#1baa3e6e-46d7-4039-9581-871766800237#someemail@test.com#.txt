0:0:55.200 --> 0:1:22.320
Steve Smith
I'm part of the Contoso team and we are here to actually do an assessment of GitHub copilot and a quantitative assessment with some of the teams within Fabrikam to understand how a GitHub copilot can actually help improve the sprints and speed up as well as velocity and code quality of the code that the teams are generating.
0:1:22.830 --> 0:1:29.890
Steve Smith
And essentially we are here to actually discuss this GitHub copilot we testing.
0:1:31.280 --> 0:1:34.710
Steve Smith
And going to the team introductions really quickly.
0:1:37.690 --> 0:1:44.180
Steve Smith
So and on the Fabrikam side, Jon and Dave are a leading us for this.
0:1:44.250 --> 0:1:52.520
Steve Smith
These two projects actually two projects that we're working on and from Contoso, Sue and Sponge Bob are leads.
0:1:53.590 --> 0:1:56.80
Steve Smith
I'm the general SME.
0:1:56.290 --> 0:2:5.280
Steve Smith
Square Pants and PaperWeight are DevOps SMEs and Betty has been helping with both the projects execution.
0:2:5.890 --> 0:2:12.50
Steve Smith
So really looking at very quickly looking at GitHub copilot next slide.
0:2:14.260 --> 0:2:52.310
Steve Smith
Uh, so Microsoft, so Contoso actually partners with Microsoft and GitHub on on variety of projects, and particularly the GitHub copilot and GitHub copilot has been like a very successful pilot within Microsoft several teams, as you see in the numbers here, several teams within Microsoft have been using and also contributing back to improving GitHub copilot such that wider audience such as Contoso, Fabrikam other tech companies can actually start leveraging the GitHub copilot.
0:2:52.320 --> 0:3:2.610
Steve Smith
GitHub copilot is essentially like a general tool where in the back end is open the eye, GPT, 3.5 and four.
0:3:3.20 --> 0:3:13.100
Steve Smith
And sorry, 3 point 3.5 and four and also it is it is learned on the corpus of large corpus of code.
